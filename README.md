# Fine-Tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) for Domain-Specific Applications

## Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to enhance its performance in a specific domain. The model has been trained using domain-specific datasets to improve its understanding and text generation capabilities in that field.

## Project Structure
- `notebook.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the fine-tuning process.
- `data/` - Directory containing the domain-specific dataset.
- `config/` - Configuration files for training and hyperparameter tuning.
- `models/` - Saved fine-tuned models.
- `README.md` - This document explaining the project.
- `report.pdf` - Detailed documentation covering the methodology, evaluation, and results.

## Domain Selection
The selected domain is **[Specify Domain]** due to its data availability, relevance, and potential impact on industry applications.

## Dataset
The dataset used for fine-tuning is sourced from **[Specify Source]** using Hugging Face datasets. It consists of domain-specific articles, reports, and manuals.

## Model Selection
We used **[Specify Pre-trained Model]** as the base model for fine-tuning. The model was chosen based on its size, efficiency, and adaptability to domain-specific tasks.

## Fine-Tuning Process
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and tokenizing domain-specific text.
2. Model Configuration: Setting up training parameters.
3. Fine-Tuning: Training the model on domain-specific datasets.
4. Evaluation: Comparing performance with baseline models.

## Installation & Usage
### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
